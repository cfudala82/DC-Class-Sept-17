    <h1>Introducing Apex Ping</h1>
    <div>
      <p class="p1">I’d like to introduce Apex Ping! A minimalistic, but
        powerful uptime & performance monitoring service for websites and APIs.
        In this post I’ll cover features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it
        first, and a few things I learned in the process. In future posts I’ll
        be detailing the implementation for anyone who is curious.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda,
        with 500 users it has already detected over a million errors, and
        performed over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters who
        have checked it out!

      <h2>
        The product
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">
        I’ve seen first-hand how embarrassing it can be when customers find out
        your product is having issues before you do, naturally this can
        translate to customers bailing on your product. Ensuring your site,
        app, or API is stable and performant is critical.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Apex Ping helps by making sure your team is notified when there’s a
        performance regression, or when your end-point is down or unresponsive.
        Often people rely on “it works for me”, but Apex Ping’s reporting can
        help uncover the full story.

      <h2>
        Powerful monitoring
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">
        Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which only support HEAD
        requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies as well. This
        allows you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving time, as well
        as the typical connection latency.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        The checks listing displays the uptime, mean response, Apdex score, and
        Adpex score throughout the day, week, or month. The Apdex score
        generalizes the user experience, summarizing response time satisfaction
        and error responses.

      <h2>
        Global checks
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">
        Requests or “checks” are performed from a number of selectable PoPs
        (Point of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer experience all
        over the world. Hovering a PoP provides you with the breakdown, and
        coloring indicates their relative health so you can instantly see if a
        region’s availability or performance is degraded.

      <h2>
        Latency distribution
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">
        When latency is a reflection of the user-experience, it’s important not
        to ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides you with an intuitive
        look at distribution throughout the selected time period, where the
        intensity of the heatmap represents the number of check’s within the
        given duration.

      <h2>
        Errors & Apdex
      </h2>
      <p class="p1">
        The Apdex (Application Performance Index) score quantifies the
        user-experience based on a configured target latency. It effectively
        lets you know how far you are from hitting your mark, you should strive
        for a perfect 1.0!
